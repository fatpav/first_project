Welcome to Fixture Fixer, if you ever had a desire to match up any team you can think of and invent some scores THEN list them, then this is your app!

The buttons are pretty clearly marked allowing you to enter teams into the database, create fixtures for them and then edit the scores.
You can also click the team names to display a list of their previous results. Lovely stuff.

It's been created simply to show how to access and create links betweem SQL databases.

It's pretty damn ugly so I'm sorry about that.  For an object lesson in how to pull your arse from the fire, call me!
